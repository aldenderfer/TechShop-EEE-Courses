#Course Descriptions

###Basic Electronics
Rewritten from the ground up, in this course you will learn the fundamental concepts of electrical engineering, including both signal flow and simple circuit analysis. You will experiment with breadboards - the electrical engineer's best friend - and with standard components (including batteries, resistors, buttons, and LEDs), and build several circuits. Finally, you will learn the basics of soldering, and assemble a permanent first prototype of your circuit on a custom printed circuit board!

###Circuit Design with EAGLE
Firmly situated in the Information Age, you are surrounded by technology. Whether it be your cell phone in your pocket or the thermostat in your house, electronic devices will almost universally contain a printed circuit board (PCB) of some kind, which allow for the interconnection of individual components. Enter into the world of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) with this course, and learn how to harness the tools necessary to design your own custom PCB.

###PCB Milling with the Othermill
In the previous course (Circuit Design with EAGLE), you designed a PCB. This course guides you through the process of fabricating that same design on the Othermill, a miniature desktop CNC router. Built with PCBs in mind, the Othermill will allow you to create a custom PCB incredibly rapidly, dropping your turnaround time from weeks to hours.
