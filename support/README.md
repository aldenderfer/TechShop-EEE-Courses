#Course Descriptions

###Basic Electronics
As an introduction to the field of electronic circuits, you will be learn the fundamental concepts of electrical engineering, including both signal flow and simple circuit analysis. Breadboards are introduced, and you will then experiment with standard components (including batteries, resistors, buttons, and LEDs) and build several circuits. Finally, you will learn the basics of soldering, and assemble a permanent first prototype of your circuit on a custom printed circuit board!

###Circuit Design with EAGLE
Firmly situated in the Information Age, you are surrounded by technology. Whether it be your cell phone in your pocket or the thermostat in your house, electronic devices will almost universally contain a printed circuit board (PCB) of some kind, which allow for the interconnection of individual components. Enter into the world of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) with this course, and learn how to harness the tools necessary to design your own custom PCB.

###PCB Milling with the Othermill
In the previous course (Circuit Design with EAGLE), you designed a PCB. This course guides you through the process of fabricating that very design on the Othermill, a miniature desktop CNC router. Designed with PCBs in mind, the Othermill allows you to create a custom PCB incredibly rapidly, dropping your turnaround time from weeks to hours.
